An app that letâ€™s us view the raw markdown on one side and the converted markdown (to HTML) on the other side.

### Installation and Use

1. Unpack the zip.
2. Install the dependencies (``` npm install ```).
3. Run the server (``` node server.js ```).


**Note** : If you end up refreshing your page, then all your work will be lost. I was looking for adding **ShareJS** to the backend (storing markdown files with **Redis**) and attaching it with the express server on ShareJS but I am not able to get their API references for now.
